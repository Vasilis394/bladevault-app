My app:
- would have homepage with sign in and sign up links
- signing up would contain username, password and confirm password. Filling everything would redirect me to signing in route (all the data will be stored in the database)
- signing in would take me to the user homepage, containing sign out and knives section
- knives route would be a list of knives
 would have option to add a new knife, which leads to new route for knife name, description, material and category, saved to user
- only the owner would be able edit and delete each knife, later saved to user
